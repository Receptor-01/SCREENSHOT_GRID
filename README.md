1. Place PNG imgs in the `input` folder.
2. Run `compile_grid.bat`.
3. Enter:
   - Output file name
   - Title
   - Layout (G = Grid, V = Vertical)
4. Find the final image in `output/<file_name>.png`.

- Grid layout = best for overviews.
- Vertical layout = best for step-by-step guides.
- Screenshot order follows filename order.
